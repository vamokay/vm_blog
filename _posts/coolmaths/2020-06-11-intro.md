Hi guys, so as I've put on the [About][about] page, this is mostly going to be about me and things in maths I think are important. 

Fair warning, a lot of it will be stuff I don't necessarily understand that well, but I'll obviously be as honest as possible. 

To start, I thought I'd talk a little bit about sets, they're incredibly important (you might even say [the most important][sets]) constructions underpinning a lot of mathematics. 

So ... what is a set? At heart, it's just a collection of distinct objects. These can be physical objects but they can also be concepts such as numbers or colours. 

The classic question in maths, once you have an object, is: how do we get new ones? Let's start with some notation, and an example. Sets tend to be denoted by capital letters $$A, B$$ etc.

We then denote

$$A \cup B = \{x \in A \; \text{and} \; x \in B\}$$

I'll try and add diagrams to illustrate what's going on eventually. For now, let's just get the post working.
